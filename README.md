A Hot-Swappable Genetic Switch: Building an inducible and trackable functional assay for the essential gene MEDIATOR 21

Abstract
Essential genes, estimated at approximately 20% of the Arabidopsis genome, are
broadly expressed and required for reproductive success. They are difficult to study, as
interfering with their function leads to premature death. Transcription is one of the
essential functions of life, and the multi-protein Mediator complex coordinates the
regulation of gene expression at nearly every eukaryotic promoter. In this study, we
focused on a core Mediator component called MEDIATOR21 (MED21), which is
required for activation of transcription. Our previous work has also shown a role for
MED21 in repression of gene expression through its interaction with a corepressor
protein. Here, we sought to differentiate the role MED21 plays in activation versus
repression using the model plant Arabidopsis. As mutations in MED21 lead to embryo
lethal phenotypes, we constructed a set of synthetic switches using PhiC31 serine
integrases to create an “on-to-off” inducible loss of function MED21 in a non-essential
tissue. Our technology, which we call Integrase Erasers, made it possible for med21
mutant plants to survive into adulthood by ablating protein expression selectively in
lateral root primordia, allowing quantification and characterization of med21 mutant
phenotypes in a post-embryonic context. In addition, we engineered chemical induction
of the Integrase Eraser to ablate MED21 expression in whole seedlings at a userspecified
timepoint. Finally, we extended this technology to build a hot swappable
Integrase Isoform Switch where expression of the integrase toggled cells from
expressing wildtype MED21 to expressing MED21 sequence variants. Our analysis of
the entire set of new integrase-based tools demonstrates that this is a highly efficient
and robust approach to the study of essential genes.
